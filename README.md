# Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Hydrocarbon-Prediction-from-Seismic-Attributes
The machine learning analysis provides an automated system for learning and improvement from input data (seismic attributes) which predict hydrocarbon in the “GEM” field. The machine learning analysis entails written codes for data exploration analysis, development and performance evaluation of the predictive models.

Note:
Prediction map dataset can be located under branch, it is the second .CSV file format with lesser timing in the table of uploaded files whereas the first .CSV file format with higher timing was used for both the development of Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) and Self Organizing Map Neural Network (SOM) model. This first .CSV file format can be found both at main and branch.
