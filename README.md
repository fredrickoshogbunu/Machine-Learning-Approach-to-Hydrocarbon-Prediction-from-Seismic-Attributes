# Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Hydrocarbon-Prediction-from-Seismic-Attributes
The machine learning analysis provides an automated system for learning and improvement from input data (seismic attributes) which predict hydrocarbon in the “GEM” field. The machine learning analysis entails written codes for data exploration analysis, development and performance evaluation of the predictive models.

Note:
Prediction map dataset can be located under branch, it is the second .CSV file in the table with lesser timing.
